                    <p>Back in 2009 I began with an idea of uploading content to my YouTube channel under the name "MaxZorin44456", several years later in 2013, I began uploading content featuring myself and several of my friends playing a variety of video games in the traditional "Let's Play" format. While this carried on for a while without any major issues personal issues followed by a hardware failure resulting in the loss of all of my video footage and editing materials resulted in me effectively abandoning the channel until 2016.</p>
                    <p>Following the rather significant hiatus from the channel I began to identify several issues with the channel, firstly while the channel itself was aesthetically pleasing the majority of the videos on the channel lacked properly edited thumbnails and as such were not enticing to new or existing viewers and did not stand out. In addition to this, the content itself had issues in several areas which were not identified during editing and could not be rectified post-edit due to the aformentioned data loss. Because of this I have since moved all of the existing videos into a "Classic Videos" playlist and made all videos without thumbnails private.</p>
                    <p>The present plan is to update all of the existing videos in the "Classic Videos" playlist as so they have thumbnails and disclaimers indicating that there may be problems with audio/video, ensure proper backups are in place to minimise the impact of hardware failures in future on the channel (and to allow me to modify videos post edit if I identify issues) and finally work out a new format in addition to the traditional "Let's Play" format as to freshen the channel and its avalible content up and make it more entertaining to watch.</p>
