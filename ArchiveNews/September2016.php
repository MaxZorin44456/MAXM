                    <b><p>September 2016</p></b>
                            
                            <p>Unfortunately the update for September has also been released a LOT later than expected. With September having snuck up on me and Rome having given me some time to reflect I stuck the "News" page and the related monthly updates on the backburner while I got some other things in my life sorted out.</p>
                            
                            <p>Despite the delay I have some nice news relating to developments in September which are outlined below.</p>
                            
                            <p><b>MaxZorin44456.com</b></p>
                            
                            <p>Unfortunately there is no news apart from that relating to me having updated my website, the reasons for this I'll explain in a moment once I've covered the updates themselves.</p>
                            
                            <p>So the "Timesplitters" page has been brought up to spec - all of the HTML files have been moved across from the old website, any HTML files which were missing for save files that I had were also created and uploaded and I went through and ensured that all of the saves I had were backed up from the GameCube memory cards, uploaded and linked. On top of this, I have gone through and ensured that all of the maps had a variety of screenshots taken and that these were uploaded also.</p>
                            
                            <p>As noted there are no further updates to anything outside of my website this month - this is primarily because I had some time to reflect on my two weeks away and decided to dedicate my time to some things which I have been neglecting in my life.</p>
                            
                            <p>For instance I've been meaning to have an electrician install some lighting in my loft for years, I've been putting off finishing the flooring and organising of my loft for even longer than that, I have photos from Rome to sort out, I had at least 20,000 unread emails to skim through and organise, I have an abysmally large external drive which is a complete mess - overall I just have a lot of stuff which I feel I need to focus on before my hobbies hence I'll be spending up until around Christmas getting it all worked out and once that is done I should be in a position where I'll be able to keep things down-pat instead of having to spend weeks doing certain tasks because I let them languish.</p>
                            
                            <p>Anyhow, while I doubt it will take me till Christmas to get the more time-intensive tasks complete I will still be pre-occupied for the most part hence the update for October, November and December will probably be rather short. I'll see how it goes though and you never know, I might be able to get things done rather more quickly than expected.</p>
