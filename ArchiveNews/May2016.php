                    <b><p>May 2016</p></b>
                            
                            <p>So it's been a whole month - time to get started...</p>
                            
                            <p>Work on "Elywof Island" has been thin on the ground beyond the first two weeks this month - I've finished the ferry terminal, completed work on a small fuel transport ship, finished some more of "The Wise Traveler", finished the engine shed as well as having carried out some much needed beautification/detailing work on the Droff Wharf Railway Station and in tow having connected most of the railway infrastructure in Droff Wharf with pathways.</p>
                            
                            <p>I've added to the Timesplitters Recreation Project this month by having completed some further tiles for the "Mapmaker Tiles" portion of that project - I am aiming to complete the "Victorian" tileset first for Timesplitters 2 before moving onto additional Timesplitters 2 tilesets and then beyond working on Timesplitters Future Perfect and the original Timesplitters.</p>
                            
                            <p>In an interesting twist the transfer of the physical saves for Timesplitters 2 and Future Perfect from my old Gamecube memory cards as well as the memory cards of a friend who was able to locate them for me has occurred thus I plan to make these available at some point in the future so you can simply load them up and play them without having to go through the hassle of recreating them yourself based on the plans provided.</p>
                            
                            <p>I've also been slowly working away on the text for the radio and TV scripts for the map I am planning on making for Project Zomboid - the groundwork is mostly laid for it so it's currently just a case of fleshing it out further.</p>
                            
                            <p>Lastly, I'm not sure what my plans are going to be for the upcoming month outside of working on my website as to make room for the Timesplitters map maker saves - hopefully I'll have more to talk about next month as unfortunately this month has hit a bit of a gulch when it comes to being productive.</p>
