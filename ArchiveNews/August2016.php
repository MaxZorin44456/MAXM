					<b><p>August 2016</p></b>
                            
                            <p>Unfortunately the update for August has been released a LOT later than expected. September sort of snuck up on me and I was in a rush to get as much finished as possible before my trip to Rome hence I put the news section on a back burner hence why it is showing up in October.</p>
                            
							<p>Despite the delay I have some good news to impart for the month of August which you'll find below.</p>
                            
                            <p><b>Minecraft</b></p>
                            
							<p>August has been a very pleasant month for the "Dentonside" project - all three stages required for the release of "Dentonside (Urban Dead)" were successfully completed, the gallery for the project was updated with fresh screenshots and it was released to the public on "Planet Minecraft" before I flew out to Rome.</p>
                            
                            <p>As was noted in the "July 2016" update I was planning on creating a second evacuation point - while this was my original intention I have decided to can this idea and have left this out as I felt this would leave the suburb feeling too crowded - I feel that overall this doesn't impact the map negatively to any great extent so hopefully it shouldn't be much of a problem.</p>
                            
                            <p>In addition to this I was able to progress with "Stage 4" and the secondary map "Dentonside - 1 Year After" has been created, the biomes have been changed and all external lighting has been rendered non-functional. As a result of this there is lots of snow and the suburb is already starting to feel like it has been uninhabited for a long period of time which is nice.</p>
                            
                            <p>And lastly before I finish up, for those who are interested you can find the "Planet Minecraft" page for the initial release of Minecraft here: <a href="http://www.planetminecraft.com/project/malton-urban-dead/" target="_blank">Dentonside - Planet Minecraft Page</a>.</p>
