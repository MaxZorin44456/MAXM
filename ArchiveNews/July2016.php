                    <b><p>July 2016</p></b>
                            
                            <p>My apologies, this month’s news is coming to you over a week and a half later than scheduled – as noted last month I was in London so I've been trying to get back into my routine again.</p>
                            
                            <p>Alright, this month marks a nice breakthrough in one of my Minecraft projects which are outlined below.</p>
                            
                            <p><b>Minecraft</b></p>
                            
                            <p>The "Dentonside" project is nearing full 4-stage, 100% completion - at current all external walls and roads/destruction outside of the suburb have been completed, inside the suburb all buildings have been constructed and are undergoing furnishing leaving only the remaining buildings and some external building work (e.g. air conditioning & parked cars) to be completed.</p>
                            
                            <p>This process has been a fairly quick and easy to complete - I'm currently hovering around a 60% completion rate for the interior furnishing meaning once that is done I just need to make some road traffic for the carparks and finish off the second evacuation point and stage 1-3 will be finished.</p>
                            
                            <p>Following the above stage 4 requires some adaption to the biome (changing it to a snowy biome) and external/internal work to buildings to add a "ruin factor" to the map as to make it appear to have been through a year of abandonment, decay and overall inhabitation by desperate survivors.</p>
                            
                            <p>I'm hoping to have the above complete by September at the latest primarily because I'll be in Rome for two weeks as of that point and I love arbitrary points in which to conclude business...</p>
                            
                            <p>As noted I'm in Rome in September for half the month so I 'm not sure what I'm going to update this page with at that point - I'll probably sort out the Timesplitters section of my site in my spare time during September and go with that.</p>
