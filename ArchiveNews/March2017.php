					<b><p>March 2017</p></b>
                            
                            <p>Righty, it's 2017, it's coming up to the end of March and it's been several months since the "news" section was last updated, time to change all of that.</p>
                            
							<p>So, a brief update regarding the status of the website before I begin...</p>
                            
                            <p>The website was "down" from just before New Years Day 2016 till around late March 2017 while it went under some serious renovation. I can happily confirm however that the website is now fully functional and apart from some minor changes that may be required in future (e.g. adding images to pages, moving items on the front page around etc.) it's set up the way it will mostly stay.</p>
                            
                            <p><b>Minecraft</b></p>
                            
							<p>After a long period away from Minecraft while I dealt with other activities I've recently in the past week returned to it and started off a new, small project to get me back into the run of things. This project is a single building called the "Zakros Times Building" which was started in 2012 and never completed, hence I want to get it finished and uploaded to Planet Minecraft.</p>
                            
                            <p>Talking about Planet Minecraft, I've uploaded the relevant maps which meet the maximum size requirements for that site to the site itself as to take advantage of the "Schemagic 3D World Render" feature which allows you to view the maps without having to download them. This has been applied to <a href="http://www.planetminecraft.com/project/streets---timesplitters-2-recreation/" target="_blank">"Streets - Timesplitters 2 Recreation"</a>, <a href="http://www.planetminecraft.com/project/subway---timesplitters-future-perfect-recreation/" target="_blank">"Subway - Timesplitters: Future Perfect Recreation"</a>, <a href="http://www.planetminecraft.com/project/streets---timesplitters-recreation/" target="_blank">"Streets - Timesplitters Recreation"</a>, <a href="http://www.planetminecraft.com/project/mansion-3270966/" target="_blank">"Mansion - Timesplitters Recreation"</a>, <a href="http://www.planetminecraft.com/project/compound---timesplitters-2-recreation/" target="_blank">"Compound - Timesplitters 2 Recreation"</a> and <a href="http://www.planetminecraft.com/project/club-vaughan/" target="_blank">"Club Vaughan (Urban Dead)"</a>. I will apply this to all future maps uploaded to Planet Minecraft where possible as well as uploading the maps to Mediafire.</p>

                            <p>There has been some slow progress this month on constructing the flooring for the loft, this is primarily due to poor weather meaning I've been restricted using the materials that are presently too long to store inside hence are kept as covered as possible outside. Aside from this, however, progress is steady and is continuing without much in the way of a hitch.</p>
                            
                            <p>I've also begun sorting my locomotives, carriages and wagons into livery-based collections, this is just as to assist me completing my collections of the liveries I have and wish to collect in future.</p>
                            
                            <p><b>MaxZorin44456.com</b></p>
                            
                            <p>There have been some notable changes to the website since the last time it was online. Firstly a whole host of new pages and content have been added, I've added a new sitemap as to help navigation of the site and I've made a "To-Do List" page which has Trello boards embedded to aid with monitoring progression on projects currently underway which have been made public. There was a whole host of other smaller changes however I'm not able to fully recall which pages have been added but, to be honest, anything that was missing from prior to 2017 is now visible and accessible so it shouldn't be an issue.</p>
                            
                            <p><b>The Future</b></p>
                            
                            <p>So, for next/the upcoming month I am planning to finish off the "Zakros Times Building" and get it uploaded, hopefully following that the "Colourful Update" for Minecraft will have been released which means I will be looking towards overhauling the "Zakros Proles Stadium" stadium, if this is not the case, however, I will be looking towards updating the "Zakros Council Building" first before looking to sort the "Zakros Proles Stadium." Either way, however, this shouldn't take longer than a week or two for each building. Following this, I will be focusing my time primarily between two projects that need to be worked on to bring them to completion - "The Federated States of Zakros" and "The Dentonside Recreation Project: 1 Year After" Due to the length of time I expect these two projects to take I will likely need to update the "future plans" beyond that in the news update for April 2017 or May 2017.</p>
