                    <b><p>July 2017</p></b>
                            
                            <p>As you may have noticed there has been a distinct lack of monthly updates on the site, while this may seem like an indicator that work has not been progressing on my various projects, rest assured updates have been occurring behind the scenes - albeit at a slightly slower pace than I'd like, the reasons for which are outlined below.</p>
                            
                            <p><b>Personal Stuff</b></p>
                            
                            <p>It's not a frequent occurrence that I post on this site about my personal life, not because I dislike talking about myself because to be honest this site (MaxZorin44456.com) is in effect a vanity project and if you get me going I'll yabber about myself all day but instead I just don't really see it as being all too important unless it's impacting something on here... which given things recently have been affecting the content and output here I guess it's time to take the plunge and discuss my personal life a bit.</p>
                            
                            <p>Anyhow, the reason for the lack of updates of late is two fold, firstly for the past few months, I've been in a bit of a lull in terms of just being bothered to do anything. While I'm not sure of the exact reason for this malaise it's basically glassed my desire to get anything done besides sleep for thirteen hours every time Friday/Saturday rolls around and spent Sunday catching up on everything I wanted to do on Saturday before having the whole mess derail come Monday. As you can probably tell, this isn't too productive hence why I'm typing up my first "monthly update" in over three months. Alas, things seem to be slowly getting back on track so it could be worse.</p>
                            
                            <p>The second reason for the lack of updates is due to the big ol' C. No, not Communism, instead, Cancer has decided to make an appearance in my life beyond the occasional advert on TV from a cancer charity. Now to clarify I don't have cancer, instead, my Mum does.</p>
                            
                            <p>As to break the story down a bit, over a month ago my mum started complaining about having issues swallowing food, things seemed to be getting stuck/taking their time to pass into her stomach or alternately being thrown back up which prompted a doctors appointment. Following this blood work was taken, nothing seemed to be amiss, however, an endoscopy was scheduled which lead to visual confirmation that Esophageal cancer appeared to be present, biopsies later confirmed this. Following two MRI's, a PET scan, a surgical consultation, indications of an additional pancreatic cancer which turned out to be nothing and finally a week ago an oncological consult we're looking towards several months of chemotherapy followed by keyhole surgery and following that a long recovery period.</p>
                            
                            <p>So yeah, things could be better... nevertheless, I have still been progressing on things behind the scenes and as to balance out the bad I've got some nice good changes - the main changes being pictures in the monthly update instead of just bog standard text.</p>
                            
                            <p><b>MaxZorin44456.com</b></p>
                            
                            <p>Okay, so first change to note is that the website has seen a slight modification in the inclusion of images to the monthly update. In addition to that, I've updated one of the project pages which will be explained in the relevant section below.</p>
                            
                            <p>The second change to note is the inclusion of a new phplist mailing list. You can sign up for that on the page below and once signed up you will receive the monthly update straight to your inbox too.</p>
                            
                            <p><a href="https://maxzorin44456.hosted.phplist.com/lists/?p=subscribe&id=1" target="_blank">Newsletter Subscription Page</a></p>
                            
                            <p>The third change is that I've cleaned the site up a bit so the links should now take you to pages which don't include ".php" in the address bar.</p>
                            
                            <p><b>Minecraft</b></p>
                            
                            <p>The first update which also happens to be the shortest is the completion and release of the "Dentonside - 1 Year After" project to Planet Minecraft. The link to that project can be found below:</p>
                            
                            <p><a href="https://www.planetminecraft.com/project/dentonside-urban-dead-1-year-after/" target="_blank">Dentonside - 1 Year After (Winter Release)</a></p>
                            
                            <p>The second and longest update is the progress I've been making on the "Federated States of Zakros."</p>
                            
                            <p>Firstly there have been two very significant changes to the map, the terraforming is complete - the landmasses I will be working with have been fully laid out and as such all further work will be focused on construction and carrying out forestation and the map has been "upgraded" to Minecraft 1.12.1.</p>
                            
                            <p>
    					<img src="../images/Dynmap-Elywof-Isles.PNG" alt="Elywof Isles Overview - Dynmap" style="width:748px;height:421px;">
  							</p>
                            
                            <p>Due to the aforementioned terraforming having been completed I've thus been able to plot out the remaining settlements to be included thus I have been able to add Dakshot, Aeron and Athos location markers to the map to indicate where these will be constructed. In addition to this, the upgrade of Minecraft to the most recent version allows me to start using the new blocks we've been provided, most prominently the "concrete" blocks which have been used frequently in the new airport build.</p>
                            
                            <p>With the resulting markers having been put in place I have begun construction on Athos as it is the only remaining settlement on the "mainland" of the Elywof Isles which has yet to see any buildings have work started on it. I have also started and finished the construction of the "Elywof Municipal Airport" and as such all that remains to complete the airport is furnishing and some light TLC to the hangers and airport facilities.</p>

                            <p>Droff Wharf has had the first part of its cemetery completed, I've added some additional rail-traffic to the railway station at Droff Wharf, I've also added some dockside facilities and additional fishing and cargo boats as well as extending the pier to the petroleum transport ship.</p>
                            
                            <p>In addition to this the fruiter, fish monger and bakery, as well as their additional residential spaces, have been completed on the sea-front promenade. I have also constructed two farms close to the settlement and constructed a granite quarry - the farms and granite quarries, however, will require further work to complete them, primarily interior furnishing.</p>
                            
                            <p>Outside Droff Wharf the Osinwar-Droff Tunnel has been retrofitted to include an emergency escape tunnel running parallel to it. I have also constructed a railway extension which is under construction "in universe" which is hopefully taken to represent a future branch line leading up to Athos and its airport/future military installation.</p>

                            <p>I have also started and completed full work on a new CDA bunker in Droff Wharf, that has been fully furnished, lighted and connected to all the standard mod-cons a bunker can expect (e.g. footpaths/closable blast doors etc.)</p>

                            <p>And last but not least I have retrofitted the Elywof City bank to reduce latency by filling in the spaces above the lighting to ensure it doesn't lag as much as it used to.</p>
                            
                            <p><b>Strayness - Model Railway</b></p>
                            
                            <p>Next are the changes and work in the loft. The leak I alluded to has been rectified following the installation of a new window this month. Admittedly I was interested in the window primarily for ventilation purposes but the added benefit of light as well as resolving the issue of the leak by removing the rotten section and replacing the missing slates has made a massive difference and really helps make the area feel more comfortable... plus the view is excellent.</p>
                            
                            <p>In addition to this, I've only got around half of one section of the loft left to complete before I progress to fully flooring it.</p>
                            
                            <p>I have also cut the new loft hatch down to a size slightly larger than the hole it will inhabit as to allow me to trim it for a nice and snug fit, this will be installed at some point in the future to allow me to have a hatch that swings down instead of being pushed up and in.</p>
                            
                            <p>In respect to the project page for the model railway, I've completed all of the picture-taking for the site and as such all of the locomotives and rolling stock have had their associated pictures taken and uploaded. As such at this point, I just need to keep on top of new entries to the collection and maintain the listings as and when I have tested/modified them for DCC running etc.</p>
                            
                            <p><b>Project Zomboid</b></p>
                            
                            <p>I've been slowly typing away at my keyboard when I get the motivation over the past few months as to add to the growing selection of radio and TV content for the Nairn & Auldearn Recreation. At present, there isn't really anything to show off, but it is still coming together and I'm currently sitting at 3407 words total for that project.</p>
                            
                            <p><b>The Future</b></p>
                            
                            <p>Unfortunately there is another problem with the roof that needs to be dealt with, this time in one of the corners - some more slates have come loose so I will be looking to get that section repaired before it reaches the same stage as the other section I had the window installed into, primarily because It's better to remedy early than remedy late.</p>
                            
                            <p>While the aforementioned leak has made itself apparent it won't stop me completing the rest of the required work before the flooring materials get ordered and delivered this month so I have got that going for me.</p>
                            
                            <p>In addition to this once I have some additional help I plan to install the new loft hatch which will with any luck allow me to get the new swing down hatch fitted this month.</p>
                            
                            <p>I also plan to get the flooring started this month, as to how much I will be able to complete is another matter, but I will see as to how that goes along closer to the time.</p>
                            
                            <p>Depending on how my finances are this month I plan to add another locomotive and a carriage to my collection. The exact type of locomotive is to be determined but it's a toss up between a Class 08 in RTC livery or a Class 37 with TTS Sound in Railfreight Metals which I will plan on detailing and having weathered at some point in the future and the carriage will likely be another First MK2 in "Fag Packet" Livery.</p>
                            
                            <p>In respect to Minecraft, I have no specific idea as to what I will be working on however my general intention is to continue work on the residential buildings and businesses in Droff Wharf and Athos.</p>
                            
                            <p>I also intend to continue working on the TV and radio content for Project Zomboid and will likely start work on a new Google Sketchup design for my shed/workshop expansion I expect to go ahead with next year. With any luck that will be finished and uploaded this month for your viewing pleasure.</p>
