                    <b><p>June 2016</p></b>
                            
                            <p>My apologies, this month’s news is going to be short and is coming to you just short of a week later than expected – I’ve been dealing with some personal matters which has delayed my release of this month’s news update.</p>
                            
                            <p>Alright, most of this month is relating to Minecraft with some minor information relating to Project Zomboid.</p>
                            
                            <p><b>Project Zomboid</b></p>
                            
                            <p>Alrighty, starting off small I’ve been having a look and apparently according to the Mondoid’s and in addition to that some of the information scattered around recently by the Dev’s WordZed has an undetermined period until it’s release due to it being somewhat non-user friendly so no idea as to when that’ll be coming out and when I’ll thus be progressing the radio and TV scripts for my map. Talking about maps – creative mode for Project Zomboid will likely be coming out at some point following the animation update so we’ve a-ways before we see any movement from that front.</p>
                            
                            <p><b>Minecraft</b></p>
                            
                            <p>I’ve been slowly trailing along with the “Dentonside” project – I’m just shy of 90% completion of the first part – following this I will need to work on furnishing all of the buildings which will hopefully be a rather quick process.</p>
                            
                            <p>Now come the 21st I’m going to be in London for a long weekend, due to this I will be away from my PC and thus unable to contribute to any of my outstanding projects – hopefully I’ll be able to pick back up before the end of the month however this isn’t a guarantee so the next monthly update may be rather barren.</p>
