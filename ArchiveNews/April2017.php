					<b><p>April 2017</p></b>
                            
                            <p>April 2017 has come to a close and as such it's time to have a look at what's been happening over the previous month.</p>
                            
                            <p><b>Minecraft</b></p>
                            
                            <p>In the realm of "Minecraft", the past few weeks have been rather busy. The "Zakros Times Building" has been fully completed and uploaded to Planet Minecraft, the "Zakros Proles Stadium" has been fully overhauled and uploaded to Planet Minecraft and in addition to that the "Zakros Council Building" has been completely overhauled and as per the previous two examples uploaded to Planet Minecraft.</p>
                            
                            <p>Links to all of these projects can be found below:

                            <p><b>Strayness - Model Railway</b></p>
                            
                            <p>The flooring in the loft has been coming along nicely, I've fully completed setting down the beams to hold the flooring on two out of the three initial sections I wanted to work on, the insulation has been relayed in between these joists and I've begun working on the last section I wanted to cover.</p>
                            
                            <p>I'd also like to "welcome" two new additions to my rolling stock, the first being a RES (Rail Express Systems) wagon and the second addition being the Serco train pack by Hornby. The website has yet to be updated with the relevant information for both of these additions as one of them is still in transit awaiting delivery, however, the website has already been updated with information relating to the RES wagon.</p>
                            
                            <p><b>The Future</b></p>
                            
                            <p>For the upcoming month I am planning to finish the remaining section of the loft and get to work on the two remaining sections, overall, however, I will be unlikely to be looking towards anything further than putting down temporary flooring this month. I also encountered a leak in my roof which will need to be dealt with however that's another matter entirely.</p>
                            
                            <p>I am also planning on finishing the second and final part of "Dentonside", this part being the "1 Year After" update set in the winter following the evacuation of Malton and begin work again on the "Federated States of Zakros" as to try and get as much of that done as possible.</p>
                            
                            <p>I will probably (no guarantees) be looking towards working on some of the thumbnails for my YouTube channel this month, this is to try and get that backlog out of the way before I seek out a new webcam and get back into the groove again for uploading content.</p>
