                            <p>I was introduced to the game "Minecraft" in early 2011, while I had vaguely heard of the game prior to that point I had never invested any time looking into it. One fateful afternoon, however, I was invited across to my friend's house regarding a new game he had found and from there I was introduced to Beta 1.2 of the indie game "Minecraft."</p>
                            <p>On the 22nd of February 2011 I purchased the game for myself, it was at this point that I began my first world - several weeks passed and I turned a small dug-out in the side of a hill into a home. After establishing a garden, a door bell, a separate entrance to the mine and I began work on an underground tunnel to connect up to a dock by the coast - this came to a swift close and with the death of my enthusiasm came the end of the house as I filled it with TNT, struck it and made for cover.</p>
                            <p>Several years have passed since my original cave turned house turned crater was abandoned however I continue to work on numerous projects in Minecraft which you can see in more detail via their project pages listed on the left-hand side.</p>
