                    <p>Following the changes in OpenTTD allowing for maps to be generated up to 4096x4096 I found out about the "UK 4096x4096" heightmap on "BaNaNaS" and while I was initially uninterested in the heightmap due to it being a heightmap searching around revealed that there wasn't much in the way of scenarios or alternately save-games for UK based 4K maps. As such I've decided to take the task upon myself to create a reasonably accurate 4K map and not so accurate save game.</p>
                    <p>In relation to the above I've outlined the current plans below for this map.</p>
                    <p><b>Scenario Information:</b>
                        <li>Lighthouses are to be accurately placed.</li>
                        <li>Major TV masts are to be accurately placed.</li>
                        <li>Population data is based off of 2011 cenus data for the Republic of Ireland and the UK.</li>
                        <li>All data is divided by 60 and all included towns must have a population greater than 5000 people (equivilent to 80 people ingame.) Cities however do not need to meet this requirement.</li>
                        <li>Industry will be placed based on current and some historical locations of UK Industry.</li>
                        <li>Motorways & major roads will be placed where possible.</li>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p><b>Save Game Information:</b>
                        <li>I'm not going to aim to replicate the UK networks, instead I will be working as owner of several companies and will form my own save with a fictional UK transport network.</li>
                        <li>I will likely provide several versions of the saves as time goes along for people to play around with.</li>
                        <li>I will also try and create a diary as I go through detailing all of the changes as they go through for the relevant companies.</li>
                        <li>I will try to focus on aesthetics and realism over pure profit, simply to keep things interesting.</li>
                        <li>I'll try to use the infastructure sharing patch if it works to make things even more interesting however no guarantees.</li>
