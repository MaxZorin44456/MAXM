                    <p>With SimCity (2013) having come across to me as rather subpar in comparison with Cities Skylines and SimCity 4 and Cities Skylines unfortunately not scratching my itch for nostalgia and perfectly aligned roads I've decided to dig out SimCity 4, brush off the dust and give it's region and city building provisions a good going over.</p>
                    <p>At present it should be noted I have some ideas in place but there is nothing concrete, I'm not overly enthused by the idea of using the region editor, unfortunately it never really struck me as an enjoyable task and instead I will likely be using a downloaded/default region and focusing my energy on building a full, pleasant region with a mixture of cities, towns, villages, farming communities and whatever else takes my fancy.</p>
                <p>At present as no work is currently taking place on this project further information and progress relating to this project will be placed on this page and/or within the news page.</p>
