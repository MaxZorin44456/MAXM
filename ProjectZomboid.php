                    <p><b>Mapping Project</b></p>
                    <p>The idea I have in mind, this project, it's for a map within Project Zomboid that is set within the Scottish Highlands. Much like Muldraugh and West Point the focus of my project (a little village called Auldearn and a somewhat larger town called Nairn) would be rural in nature and feature a reasonably diverse collection of buildings to inhabit during your travels through the ruinous wastes. At present I'm not sure as to when I'd actually be able to progress this project. The creative mode hasn't been mentioned since 2015 (as far as I can tell) and I'm presently occupied with a litany of other projects. I'll keep you updated as it progresses however. <I>(Last Updated: 14/02/2019)</I></p>

                    <p><b>Radio & TV Project</b></p>
                    <p>Okay, to tie in with the aformentioned "Mapping Project" I am also in the process of producing a radio & TV script for this map. It's currently a work in progress. I have started work on two radio stations, one is "complete" to the extent that it's non-emergency broadcasts are done. The other is in progress, while I have a further seven radio stations planned and at least five TV stations planned. You should be able to see progress on this project within the ""To-Do List" which is linked at the top of my site.</p>
                    <p>I am also planning on adding recorded media (VHS tapes, casette tapes etc.) if and when the PZ Dev team add this functionality.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>Writing & Supplementary Written Materials</b></p>
                    <p>As part of the process of establishing the "lore" for the Radio and TV for my map I produced some rather indepth supplementary materials. These consist of local and national government documents which concern the outbreak within the UK. I've thus far released two of these documents, one of which is a "Official Timeline" produced by the UK Government and the other being an unpublished, draft civil defence guide named "PAV and YOU" which is loosely based on the very much real, Protect and Survive document produced for nuclear war during the 80s. Links to both of these can be found below.</p>

                    <p><b>Please Note: </b><I>In time I am intending on adding links to PDF copies of these documents, you can also find them in the somewhat less straightforward and more "interactive" section of my website. <a href="/PZ1993Web/CCTADirectory"> A link to that is here.</a></I></p>
                    <p>I presently have more documents planned, as I release them, I will include them here.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>Trailers/Video Material</b></p>
                    <p>At present I am working on a few "trailers" that are in a similar vein to the Emergency Broadcast System mock tests people have put up on YouTube. They're nothing fancy, but should add some interesting material to look at. I'll update this section with links to them once I've finished editing them.</p>
