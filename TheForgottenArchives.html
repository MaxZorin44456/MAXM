                    <p><b>Minecraft:</b> Numerous attempts at Elywof City and the greater Zakros Empire were attempted before I finally settled on the current map that is being worked on today - several of them fell to the wayside following updates to terrain generation within Minecraft that occurred before I had started using Bukkit/VoxelSniper. I have a few left over which have managed to survive to this day via old backups which I have updated to run off of the most recent version of Minecraft. You can also find a copy of the first ever "world" I created when I first bought and played Minecraft. These are available for download below.

                    <p><p><b>Project Zomboid:</b> I began work on turning the office in Muldraugh using the "Hydrocraft" and "Cars" mod into a reasonably half decent fortress kitted out with all of the amenities of the day you could ever hope for - unfortunately "Fort Scott" was, for the most part, lost following a HDD failure and due to sloppy backups a lot of the progress was lost. As a result, the garage and rear extension were lost however a majority of the interior and some exterior work concerning securing the carpark was retained. As I've currently lost interest in pursuing progress with "Fort Scott" I've decided to upload it here.</p>
