                    <p>The original idea for the "Federated States of Zakros" began back in 2011 shortly after the demolition of my first house in Minecraft. The project started with a small fort and then later an airstrip and slowly expanded into the fort taking on the name of "Elywof City" and the region it resided in taking on the name of the capital - Zakros. Slowly over time Elywof City was joined by smaller towns and settlements connected initially by a footpath then a double-lined Minecart system allowing direct connections to all of the major cities and towns.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately due to the 1.2.1 update within Minecraft notable issues with the existing terrain and newly generated terrain lead to the death of the original map and a new venture opened wherein I attempted to start a new version of the map. The process of recreating the map and starting fresh occurred several more times due to disliking the terrain I was dealing with or otherwise feeling discontent with how the project was going until I eventually settled on the current map that is being worked on today.</p>
                    <p>By early June 2012 I'd managed to complete the majority of the interior construction of Elywof City and following that began working on the "McMoney Building" for the capital - Zakros. Due to the sheer scale of the building I was constructing and due to being unaware of the program MCEdit at the time this process dragged on until late 2012, by early 2013 however I had managed to furnish the entirety of said building in addition to all of the buildings within Elywof City and construct a new hospital/cemetery for Elywof City and establish the location of the next village, Osinwar.</p>
                    <p>In 2013 progress began to slow as I adopted the tools "Bukkit", "WorldEdit" and "McEdit" and began applying them to the map. While this sounds like it should have speeded up progress this was not the case as I began to understand the power of the utilities at hand and began to implement plans for their use. During this time I established the best location of the Elywof City branch of the Bank of Zakros and with the help of a close friend (the same close friend who created the banner shown at the top of this site/my YouTube channel) this building was constructed and provided with a vault secured with a functioning locking mechanism requiring the correct pin to gain access without resorting to brute force.</p>
                    <p>During 2013 work on Elywof City and Osinwar slowed to a crawl and came to a complete stop as I focused all of my energies on terraforming what would become the "Elywof Isles", in 2014 however due to becoming significantly bored with the grind of terraforming I took a break and focused on rebuilding the interior of Elywof City and demolishing the old Elywof City Medical Clinic and replacing it with a new shiny version. The resulting "shiny version" of the medical clinic while incorporating extensive redstone lighting, working elevators and a functioning fire alarm system was horrifically laggy and notably out of character with the area and found itself being demolished before the end of 2014 and being replaced with a heavily modified variant of the original building. <I>(Interesting Trivia Time! As of 2017 the only part of the second hospital that still exists is the stairs down to the CDA shelter and the shelter itself located underneath the building.)</I></p>
                    <p>September 2014 marked the shift of the majority of my time to an alternate project I wanted to work on - the "Dentonside Recreation Project" due to Bukkit having been hit by a DCMA takedown and by proxy VoxelSniper becoming virtually useless, work on this alternate project continued until around September 2015 wherein I was made aware of Bukkit having become available for Minecraft Version 1.8.8 which resulted in me being able to complete the majority of the terraforming of the main island by April 2016. By May 2016 a new town called "Droff Wharf" had been established and connected by road and rail to Osinwar/Elywof City.</p>
                    <p>Beyond 2016 not much has really occurred with this project however 2017 will feature this as a priority for completion and a major focus for my time and energies.</p>

                  <p>It should be noted that there is a small collection of buildings that were constructed originally with the intention being that they'd be used to help populate the urban area of Zakros once I reached that area... unfortunately as Zakros is likely off the cards permanently at this point I've decided to clean up and remodel these builds and upload them to Planet Minecraft. As such you can find the links to these builds below.</p>
