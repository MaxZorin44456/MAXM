                    <p>In the glorious year of 2009 the desire to upload content to YouTube under a centralised "brand" came to fruition and a small gaming-orientated channel called "MaxZorin44456" was born. Over five years later in 2013 following the Earth imploding and the universe turning into something resembling that Dali painting with all the droopy clocks I began uploading content featuring myself and several of my friends playing a variety of video games in the well-known "Let's Play" format.</p>
                    
                    <p>Since those early days I have expanded the focus of "MaxZorin44456" from just a YouTube channel into a larger branding which encompasses my existing projects and future creative endeavours. To this end, I hope to centralise my projects, keep things organised and with any luck entertain a few curious Internet travellers passing through at the same time.</p>
                    
                    <header><h3><b>About Max</b></h3></header>
                    
                    <p>Max is currently residing outside of Inverness, Scotland. When he's not busy typing out things in the third person you can more often than not find him at home working on something new, editing something existing, skirting Reddit or just otherwise dreaming of a less melted tomorrow.</p>

                            <li>"Can I help you with a project/work with you on something?"</li>
                            <li><I>I'm afraid I will likely have to decline unless you have some existing work which you can show to confirm you would be suitable to assist. Generally speaking, however, it would depend on what exactly the task is, it's not a one-size-fits-all request, unfortunately.</I></li>

                            <li>"Can you help me with a project/work with me on something?"</li>
                            <li><I>It depends on what it is you are proposing really as to if I'd be able to/want to help. For instance, if I feel I wouldn't be able to do something justice I'm not going to be overtly enthusiastic and will likely decline. Also, it will highly depend on time constraints and just as to how well I feel my style would mesh with your own so I have to look at these things on a case by case basis.</I></li>

                            <li><I>It's Scottish, but more precisely It's a mixture of Glaswegian from my parents, Essex from when I was younger and the variety of dialects from where I live.</I></li>

                            <li><I>While I cannot be certain I suspect it was either Thomas or Percy from a Thomas the Tank Engine themed set, outside of that I'm pretty certain it was my "First" liveried Class 47 (L204825) by Lima..</I></li>
