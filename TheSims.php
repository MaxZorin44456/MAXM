                    <p>While The Sims has always been a favourite of mine nothing has really peaked my attention like the Sims 2 and as a result, I wish to finish something I tried to start when I was a lot younger... building a whole neighbourhood from scratch and populating it. The main aesthetic of the town is that of a sleepy mountain town balanced between the precipice of the 21st and 20th century which as a result will feature a mixture of people and building styles however it will mostly remain within what you would expect of a North American town in the Rocky Mountains.</p>
                    <p>At present I've begun working on the project, however, I haven't updated it in quite a while hence any further updates to the project will be listed here and on the news page.</p>
