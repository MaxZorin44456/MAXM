                    <p>While I was unfortunate in being unable to experience text adventures/interactive fiction first hand I have been in recent years dabbling with the idea of creating a few works of Interactive Fiction. For the most part, I have decided upon using "Quest" for this task and at present, I only have one project which is lightly discussed below which is still undergoing work.</p>
                    <p>So the title for my project is "Just You and The Dust Now…" and for the most part it concerns exploring an abandoned house and if you decide to venture outside, the nearby area too. There isn't necessarily a "goal" in so far as exploring and uncovering elements of the house and what exactly has occurred.</p>
                    <p>At some point I wish to expand on the universe within "Just You and The Dust Now…" however I will likely go for a more narrative-driven experience rather than an experience driven by text parsers and see how it turns out.</p>
