                    <p>Since the introduction of Settlements into the Fallout series I've had some fairly big ideas beyond my usual hoarding of bottlecaps, guns and rusty tin cans - given the addition of modding to this and the release of the Fallout 4 Creation Kit there is a lot of room to "grow" my ideas if you will.</p>
                    
                    <p>In relation to the above at present I want to run through a few ideas, primarily relating to expanding the relationship between the Minutemen and the Brotherhood of Steel via quests in which you can foster relations between the two factions and unite them and begin the slow process of rebuilding the Commonwealth into something vaguely resembling something civilised, the focus of settlements towards a specific purpose above all else (e.g. brahmin farming, crops, manufacturing etc.) and overall the restructuring the end of the Fallout 4 into something wherein you attempt to grow something in the ashes of what once was.</p>
