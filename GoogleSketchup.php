                            <p>I was introduced to the software "Google SketchUp"/"SketchUp" by a close friend (the same person who made the banner a the top of this site and at the top of my YouTube channel) while he was using it to design some furniture to fit into an alcove. While I liked the look of the software and was very much interested it wasn't until late 2016 that I began using. After fiddling around with the software I created a reasonably accurate replica of the original grey PS1 case.</p>
                            <p>Following this I decided to spend some time measuring out my loft and seeing what would come out the other side in SketchUp. While my first attempt at this failed miserably the second attempt was a success and I have used it to create an accurate replica of my loft, complete with additional flooring I plan to lay out to make access and storage easier.</p>
                            <p>In addition to the shelving and PS1 case I have also used SketchUp to design some furniture for my room, this primarily consists of a shelving unit which will hold some existing boxes I have along with something to give me more storage space underneath my wardrobe and a new shelving unit to hold my 3D Printer, filament spools and other associated items.</p>
                            <p>At present my next plan for SketchUp is to sketch out an accurate representation of my shed to facilitate a new door, window, storage shelf, workbench and to also sketch out my garden to facilitate some further work I wish to carry out to it. These designs will be uploaded once completed like those on the left-hand side and any additional SketchUp projects will also feature on this page.</p>
