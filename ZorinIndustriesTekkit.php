                    <p>For many years I have used Tekkit and while I have dabbled in the wonders of nuclear fission, canning machines and oil refineries I felt it was time I gave myself a nice change of pace - instead of creative mode being used I would play Tekkit Legends in survival mode with the emphasis being to create an industrial and scientific marvel complete with all the mod cons and of course... bees (who could forget the bees.)</p>
                    <p>At present I have no idea as to when this will be complete, it's not necessarily a priority for me and is more a way for me to relax than anything else however once complete I do intend to upload it to Planet Minecraft and it will feature in the "News" section for the months where it is worked on.</p>
